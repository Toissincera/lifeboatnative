Imma keep it real with y'all, this place is falling apart, here be dragons and all that.

React Native, React Native Navigation, Expo, Expo Go, styled-components, and a buncha other shit don't work with each other no good.

I'll find a good balancing point for each's version, where everything co-exists, and then, sadly, stay there until the next pipe break chicanery. Until then, hang tight.

Yes, I have been informed that this is, in fact, a buncha malarkey with a smidgen of tomfoolery and a sida buffoonery. :(
